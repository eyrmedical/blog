# Caught a springtime cold? How do you know it’s not allergies?
With one of the earliest [allergy seasons](https://www.nrk.no/livsstil/pollensesongen-rekordtidlig-i-gang-_-i-januar-1.13346284) on record, it is especially important to be aware of any allergy-like symptoms. You may be surprised to discover that what you thought was a cold, is actually a reaction to pollen or other allergies. Since an easy fix is often available, there is no reason to live with itchy, watery eyes, sneezing, stuffy or runny nose or fatigue. Speak with a doctor and try out a few different medications to [find the right one for you](https://blog.iodine.com/youre-probably-taking-the-wrong-allergy-medication-df63c27c5036). And remember to start any medications as early as possible, preferably before allergy season starts.

Every year, spring arrives and I feel great — longer days and more sunlight means more energy. But then I get cold-like symptoms and wonder, “is this a cold or is it allergy?” I go through the season with symptoms that are more annoying than alarming, and I don’t think it’s worth the trip to the doctor. However, my symptoms cause me not to sleep well, which turns into fatigue and difficulty with focus. By the time I think it’s finally time to go to the doctor, the symptoms have started to clear up and I figure “I’m fine.” Then the next spring I do it all over again, without having learned anything from the year before.

This may not seem like that big of a deal, but untreated allergies can [actually cause asthma](https://www.abcnyheter.no/livet/2017/03/30/195291646/ubehandlet-allergi-oker-muligheten-utvikle-astma). And those months of symptoms can end up with taking sick days from work and make you less productive while you are there. Not to mention a miserable 17th of May!

A mild winter and early warm weather in Norway this year has brought with it [record levels of pollen](https://www.nrk.no/livsstil/pollensesongen-rekordtidlig-i-gang-_-i-januar-1.13346284) beginning as early as January. Climate changes have meant that allergy season is beginning earlier and lasting longer. And with more mild winters likely to continue, we must prepare for even earlier and more intense pollen seasons to come. Even higher elevations are showing increased pollen counts, when trips to the mountains used to be one source of relief.

[Norwegians](http://www.allergiguiden.no/nyhet/klimaendringer-oeker-allergiplagene/) especially may be more prone to allergies because — being from a colder climate — generations have lived here with less contact with microbes and [less vitamin D](https://www.verywell.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-causes-asthma-and-allergies-83031). Now with a fairly drastic climate change, the [European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology](http://www.eaaci.org/) predicts that more than half of the European population will have some kind of allergic symptoms in the next 15 years. Norway is no exception.

Ragweed, for instance, is a North American weed that has been spreading across Europe in recent years. It is one of the most common allergens worldwide, affecting the most people. And since it has a late pollination cycle, it can often make the pollen season even longer. Ragweed is not currently in Norway, however in recent years it has made its way into Denmark and Sweden. Some people that have never had allergies before are experiencing allergy symptoms for the first time because of it and other climate changes.

If you are allergic to Alder or Hazel, your symptoms have probably already started. Birch will begin closer to the end of April. Here are a few ways you can help ease allergy symptoms right away:


- See a doctor and take medications prescribed by them early and regularly, as prescribed.
- Take prescribed medications even on days when you don’t feel symptoms.
- Wash your face and hands often, especially after being in pollinated places. And wash or rinse hair and change your pillowcase before bedtime.
- Good housekeeping helps to keep pollen out of your home. Be sure to mop and dust with water so you don’t just stir up the dust and pollen in your home.
- Wipe down pets with a damp cloth when they come inside.
- Air out your home and hang your clothes out to dry in the evenings, when there is less pollen in the air.
- If you can, stay indoors when it is breezy. Pollen counts tend to go up when the trees and flowers are getting blown around. And don’t forget that pollens can travel for miles, so it isn’t just your own garden that is affecting you.
- Replace filters in your ventilation systems before and after allergy season
- Look into air purifiers and carbon filters that can be purchased that are known to help (more info can be found at [NAAF](http://www.naaf.no/))
