# Breastfeeding in Norway: There is no “try”
Most people think of breastfeeding as being a beautiful gift — the ability to naturally nourish your baby, which is so instinctual, that it will come to you easily. However, when asking new parents about the difficulties of having a baby, breastfeeding is one thing that always comes up. Here, I have explored breastfeeding and what to expect. I asked mommas that are breastfeeding for their first time, seasoned mothers, midwifes, doctors and lactation consultants to share their best tips, pointers, and words of wisdom for soon-to-be moms. With almost half of Norwegian mother’s continuing to breast feed past 12 months, breastfeeding is an important part of having a baby. The reality is that for most women, breastfeeding takes a lot of patience, observation and work — so don’t feel alone — just be prepared!


- **Be ready for it to be painful and difficult**

Expect it to be challenging and then you’ll be able to be happy with your progress later on. Prepare as much as possible by talking with a lactation consultant or midwife, or taking a breastfeeding class. Go to momma classes, and connect with other mothers at a similar stage of pregnancy. Seek connections early on so you always have someone to ask questions, give advice, or provide emotional support.


- **Correct latch and position**

Finding the right latch is key in successful breastfeeding. With the correct latch you will find you have less nipple soreness, the baby will get milk easier and you’ll spend less time breastfeeding. There are also many of position aids you can use such as props, pillows, etc.


- **Consult a midwife or lactation consultant before the baby comes**

Speak with your midwife or a lactation consultant (and meet with them even before the baby comes). It is best to find the correct latch while you are still in the hospital with the round the clock help of nurses, doctors and midwifes. Don’t be nervous to ask questions.


- **Breast pump**

Use a breast pump as needed. It is especially helpful when you are starting work again. If you feel your baby is not getting enough milk, ask a doctor and don’t be afraid to use formula if instructed to do so. Breastfeeding is not easy — sometimes you need help.


- **Hydrate and eat healthy, everything you are eating, your baby is eating too!**

Take care of yourself! Take the time you need to relax, watch what you eat, and drink plenty of water. You will be very thirsty while breastfeeding, so keep water nearby. Some mothers find that certain foods create more gas or discomfort for their babies. It is a good idea to keep a close eye on how you feel and how your baby feels after you eat certain things.

Again, breastfeeding can be difficult, and there are lots of resources to find help. [A great resource for breastfeeding mothers in Norway](http://www.ammehjelpen.no/).


> **Some interesting statistics on breastfeeding in Norway:**99% of Norwegian babies are breastfed at some time.80% of babies at 6 months of age are still breastfed.At six months of age 88% of infants have been introduced to solid food.Vitamin D supplementation is common in Norway, 80% of infants received fish oil or other vitamin D supplements daily or weekly after six months of age.

A family with a new baby has a lot of health questions

**Important dates:**

- During pregnancy you will have 8–12 routine prenatal care appointments or “svangerskapskontroll”
- You are offered an ultrasound at around 18 weeks, additional ultrasounds are only offered if there are complications
- In the first days after birth, a pediatrician will perform a full checkup of the baby
- A health visitor or registered nurse will come to your home during the first weeks
- You should weigh the baby at a public health clinic between the first 7–10 days
- Your baby will receive pediatrician appointments at: 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months

If you have questions outside of those three appointments, we recommend using [Eyr Online Doctor](http://www.eyr.md/en). With the Eyr app, you can avoid taking your sick child away from home.
