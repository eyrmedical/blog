# Getting a specialist referral in Norway

## Myth-busters: How do I get a referral and who is allowed to give me one?

Norway has some unique rights as a country compared to most other countries in the world. Norway gives you, as a patient, a lot of access to your own healthcare and urges you to become a key player in your health. However, many of these rights are not used or possibly unknown to patients. That’s why we’ve taken some time to summarize your rights as a Norwegian resident so you can take more control of your health. Today we are talking about referrals to a specialist.


- According to Act 3.1 of the [Specialist Health Service Act](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1999-07-02-63/#KAPITTEL_3), private businesses that have an agreement with a local health authority are entitled to decide whether a patient has the right to necessary, medical care from the specialist and choose a deadline for when the health care must be given. This means that you don’t need to see your general practitioner to get a specialist referral — you can get a referral from any local doctor including an emergency doctor, private doctor, or online doctor.
- You have the right to decide where your referral is sent. For instance if you live in Oslo, but work in Hamar, you can request to have your referral sent to Hamar and see a doctor there.
- You are entitled to receive your referral within 30 days. (If you are under 23 you should get a response within 10 days.)
- You will then receive a deadline for the latest date at which your examination will take place. If that deadline has passed, you should contact Helse Norge to help you organize help from elsewhere. (Helse Norge can be reached [here](https://helsenorge.no/))
- You are entitled to a second opinion. If you are rejected when you have asked a doctor for a referral, you are entitled to speak with a secondary doctor. Again, you can speak with any doctor for a second opinion including an emergency doctor, private doctor, or online doctor. Eyr is a great resource for getting a second opinion from a trusted doctor.

So these are your rights as a patient, but let’s also think about the rights of a doctor and the important barriers that keep us safe. There is a reason why we educate nurses, doctors and psychologists — they spend years learning about the diseases they treat, in order to give you, as the patient, the best possible care. So here are a few rights patients do not have:


- You cannot decide that a referral will be sent. The doctor has the final say in whether or not you need the referral care that you request.
- You cannot determine the level of treatment. The doctor will decide if you need to see a basic specialist, or get a more specialized referral, and therefore which clinic you will be referred to within the area you have requested.
- And lastly, if you have acute care needs you are not entitled to decide which hospital you are sent to. These situations are high priority and are sent to the nearest, and most available hospital.

These doctor’s rights are important in protecting our health — after all, they are the experts. So understanding our rights as patients is very important in taking control of our health. Doctors are here to help, and it never hurts to ask questions.
