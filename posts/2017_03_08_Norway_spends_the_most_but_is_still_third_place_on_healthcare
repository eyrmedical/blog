# Norway spends the most but is still third place in healthcare

## A look at the European Healthcare Consumer Index 2016 

Norway sits in third place in a recent study called the [European Healthcare Consumer Index 2016](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2016/EHCI_2016_report.pdf). While we lead in outcomes, spend the third highest in per-capita spending, and excel in patient rights and information, we are failing in accessibility. Norway’s accessibility has poor scores for two of the sub-categories, one being “access to specialists”. This is due to the fact that we currently use a strict access system in order to see a specialist. There are different wait time structures based on urgency, private/public, or the type of specialist you are requesting. The overall average of these wait times is [8 weeks](https://helsedirektoratet.no/Lists/Publikasjoner/Attachments/1296/IS-2610-Ventetider-og-Pasientrettigheter-2016.pdf) — and even longer for mental health. Here at Eyr, we think digital consultations would alleviate a lot of the wait time patients deal wit when seeking a specialist.

*“Over the years, one fact becomes clear: gatekeeping means waiting. Contrary to popular belief, direct access to specialist care does not generate access problems to specialists by the increased demand; repeatedly, waiting times for specialist care are found predominately in systems requiring referral from primary care.” —* [*Arne Björnberg*](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bj%C3%B6rnberg-Spektrum-Onkologie-Wien-160930.pdf)*.*

The [European Healthcare Consumer Index 2016](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2016/EHCI_2016_report.pdf) gives some insight into where there are issues in the Norwegian healthcare access system. In the EHCI, which was released last month, Norway comes in third place for best health care in Europe. For those of you who like to dig into the numbers yourselves, you can use the link to take a look at how Norway compares to the rest of Europe. For the rest of you, I’ll provide a quick summary.

The [Health Consumer Powerhouse](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/), a health policy think-tank out of Sweden, creates the European Health Consumer Index (EHCI) publication annually. The scoring in the index is based on 6 main categories:

· Patient rights and information,
· Accessibility and wait time for treatment,
· Outcomes,
· Range and reach of services,
· Prevention, and
· Pharmaceuticals.

In the report some categories are weighted more heavily than others, and there are many more subcategories as well. Norway’s healthcare system is highly regarded when compared to other systems in Europe. In the most heavily weighted category, “Outcomes,” Norway is tied for first place with 5 other countries (Switzerland, The Netherlands, Iceland, Germany and Finland). We have our excellent doctors and healthcare workers to thank for that win. Overall the EHCI gives Norway the bronze medal (third place) behind The Netherlands and Switzerland. Even so there is room for improvement in Norway’s system. As far as the EHCI, Norway has been in the top ten since 2007, when we were placed at number 10. We may be third today, but the trailing countries are right behind — many moving at a much faster rate of improvement. Considering how well Norway does with healthcare outcomes, as well as how much we spend on healthcare, there is no reason why Norway shouldn’t be number 1 on the EHCI list. However, if we don’t make some major improvements soon, Norway could fall significantly in ranking next year.

**What could be the problem?** Let’s start with the money. As I hinted earlier, Norway spends a lot of cash on healthcare — we have the third highest healthcare spending per capita, behind only Luxembourg and Switzerland. Clearly, cash flow isn’t the problem.

To get a better idea of why Norwegian healthcare isn’t #1, let’s look at the areas where we need to improve. When compared to other EHCI countries we are close to the top for the number of doctors (over 400 for every 100,000 people) but close to the bottom for the number of patient appointments per patient, per year. Norwegian patients average just over 4 appointments per year. To better understand what that means, let’s compare to Lithuania, who has about the same number of doctors as Norway but has nearly twice the number of doctor appointments, at 8 per person, per year.

**What could be causing this wide gap in accessibility to Norwegian doctors?** Since, like I said, we place at the top for both spending and number of doctors, we can deduce that the problem is NOT having too few doctors or stretching them too thin. And according to the [Health Powerhouse](http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2016/EHCI_2016_launch_presentation.pdf), “there is virtually no correlation between money and accessibility of healthcare system.” However, even with our spending, we fall well behind the European leaders (Belgium and Switzerland) in the race for the lowest wait times for appointments. Norway is currently tied (with Italy) for 22nd place in the “accessibility and wait time for treatment” category.

Getting rid of GP “gatekeeping” may be the answer

**What are other countries doing to improve their healthcare systems?** Let’s take a look at what Norway can learn from other countries in Europe. Some say the “chaos” system, where patients can choose where, when, and from whom they seek care (without a referral), does a better job of meeting a patient’s needs than a ”planned” system. However “chaos” systems also need to be managed, usually with a countrywide e-booking system. Some countries have gained points this year with implementation of e-health. For example, Denmark has received a significant boost in points with their new e-health system. FYR Macedonia also saw a huge improvement from 27th place to 16th, in 2014, when they implemented a real-time e-booking system. This improvement was largely due to eliminating waiting lists altogether.

Waiting lists for [specialist treatments](https://blog.eyr.md/getting-a-referral-in-norway-86e410a1475) exist mainly in countries, including Norway, with “general practitioner (GP) gatekeeping,” or the requirement of a referral from a primary care doctor in order to see a specialist. GP gatekeeping is widely believed to save costs, as well as provide a continuum of care, which can certainly be beneficial to the patient. However, according to the EHCI there is no evidence to support the cost-reducing hypothesis. It may be that introducing more digital health options, allowing mobile health to play a larger role in everyday healthcare, and therefore handing over more power to the patient, could be the way to reduce wait times in Norway. [*Eyr Online Doktor*](http://eyr.md/) is a good way to allow patients to continue to get a referral from a GP without the extra wait time required in getting an appointment with his or her GP. This would take one step out of the process and free doctors to make more time for patients that need physical examinations or in-person appointments.

“The poor accessibility of Norwegian healthcare must be more or less entirely attributed to mismanagement, as lack of resources cannot possibly be the problem. The fact that it is cheaper to operate a healthcare system without waiting lists (i.e. waiting lists do not save money, they cost money) could actually explain the Norwegian situation.”
— European Health Consumer Powerhouse

All in all, the problem stems from the fact that we are slowing our own progress, specifically, in being slow to adopt digital health. Norway needs to let go of the reins a bit and give patients more control of their health. Allowing digital health care companies to step in for consultations where a physical examination is not necessary would be a great first step.
