# Rural communities need healthcare digitization

## Digitization will change healthcare access for rural communities

Norway has 5 million inhabitants who are spread over nearly 400,000 square kilometers, making it one of the most sparsely populated countries in Europe. Because of this, Norway has seen an uneven distribution of health workers between urban and rural areas as well as low capacity for doctor training. In recent years, long trips for rural patients has become an issue as specialized practices have become more centralized and smaller hospitals have been shut down. Norway has done a lot over the years to even out healthcare access. Here at [Eyr](https://eyr.md/) we believe digitization is the solution to help rural communities access health care.

Many methods have been tested over the years to promote better distribution of healthcare access in Norway.


- One method was to expand availability to medical training by opening a school in Northern Norway, in Tromsø. An internship program was also started across the country, which included training for 18 months in hospitals with vacancies — often in rural communities. The hope for this tactic was to get future health workers to settle in smaller regions near those hospitals with vacancies. The outcome often ended with a full-time job for the worker and one less vacancy in a rural hospital.
- To address low capacity for doctor training in Norway, the government offers scholarships and loans for Norwegian students to study abroad. In the past, they have also implemented open policies for nurses from Sweden.

Norway has faced shortages of doctors over the recent years, mostly due to increased demand for specialists. According to Norway’s [Health Directorate](https://helsedirektoratet.no/Lists/Publikasjoner/Attachments/1164/ventetider-og-pasientrettigheter2015-versjon-april2016.pdf), it takes an average of 8 weeks for priority patients to actually meet with a specialist — that is from the date that the referral was sent and does not include the wait time to receive the referral from a GP in the first place. According to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/jun/15/norway-centralised-healthcare-nhs-hospitals),

> “The past few years have seen a concerted attempt to centralize health services in Norway. In essence, this has meant concentrating certain types of surgery in fewer, higher-volume hospitals to improve patient outcomes. On the ground, this has meant the downgrading and closure of smaller hospitals and longer journeys for some patients. (…) One extreme [example](http://www.fremover.no/helsevesen/sykehus/unn/ma-reise-dit-de-far-behandling/s/5-17-47252) saw elderly patients having to make a 260km round trip for orthopedic treatment.”

Norway has identified some healthcare access issues and has taken strides to correct them. However, as the demand for services grows, these issues continue to appear. Digitization of health services has become a necessity — especially for rural communities. The healthcare community has already adopted some digitization, such as, using digital health records, updating core processes like manufacturing, and using digital services to connect hospitals and specialists. However, the focus so far has been on streamlining the provider’s experience rather than on patient needs. It is becoming apparent that we need to try to understand what patients really need and build products to fit to those needs.

Many companies are beginning to offer Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots to connect doctors with the most updated information and policies. Because of rapidly expanding medical knowledge and drug discoveries, it is no longer advisable for doctors to rely entirely on the human mind. Computer-aided decision support is needed to translate knowledge effectively into practice and to safely, and effectively, use the many drugs and devices currently available. With better knowledge, doctors can better diagnose illness, identify improvement opportunities, discuss a wider variety of treatment options, and implement interventions.

Preventative care is also a very important part of improving healthcare for rural patients. With so many people taking control of their own health with personal activity trackers, watching what they eat, and being mindful of their mental state, doctors have a chance to see much more data related to a patient’s everyday life. There are countless apps and devices in use to track daily health progress, but why isn’t this data being shared with a doctor when a health issue or question comes up? Sometimes it’s just a matter of connecting current technology to our healthcare providers.

In rural communities, the time it takes to physically see a doctor is longer than in urban settings. This could be preventing people from visiting their doctor at all. Video consultations can help to connect patients living in rural areas with local doctors and they can handle more than you think. As many as 30 to 40% of typical doctor appointments can be completed over video. With rural communities, having doctors easily in reach could make a big difference to the community’s overall health and wellbeing.
